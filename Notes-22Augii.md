# HA - High Availability ðŸ†™


- Ensure agreed level of operational performance.
- Run time and uptime higher than normal.
- Minimize downtime to continue operation.
- Take timing to move from one server to another.
- Use redundant systems for failover mechanisms.

When a server in a cluster fails, another server will take over.
- **99.9% HA** means 8.77 hours per year downtime.
- **99.999% HA** means 5.26 minutes per year downtime.

# FT - Fault Tolerance 
 ###### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62589b5-9841-4c1e-aa24-8f6d7deb71b4)




- Same as HA but much more.
- Ensure a system can continue operation even if a failure occurs.
- Ensure zero downtime by providing continuous operations.
- Operate through failure.
- Use redundant systems to take over without any disruption.

# DR - Disaster Recovery 


- When HA and FT do not work.
- Set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable recovery or continuity of infrastructure that faced a natural disaster.
- Involves backup and recovery processes to restore systems to a previous state.
- Focuses on data recovery and business continuity.
