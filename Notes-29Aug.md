# S3 Bucket Basics

## What is an S3 Bucket?

An S3 bucket is a container for storing objects in Amazon S3. Each bucket can store an unlimited number of objects, which are files of any type and size.

## Key Features

- **Global Namespace**: Each bucket name must be unique across all of AWS.
- **Region-Specific**: Buckets are created in a specific AWS region to optimize latency and costs.
- **Access Control**: Permissions can be set at both the bucket and object level using bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and IAM policies.

## Creating an S3 Bucket

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to S3 Service**.
3. **Click on "Create Bucket"**.
4. **Configure Bucket Settings**:
   - **Bucket Name**: Must be globally unique.
   - **Region**: Choose the AWS region.
   - **Settings**: Configure options like versioning, encryption, and logging.

## Managing Objects

- **Uploading Objects**: You can upload files to your bucket using the console, CLI, or SDKs.
- **Object Keys**: Each object in a bucket is identified by a unique key.
- **Metadata**: Objects can have metadata, which is data about the data, such as content type and size.

## Security Features

- **Encryption**: Enable server-side encryption to protect data at rest.
- **Bucket Policies**: Define rules to control access to the bucket.
- **IAM Policies**: Use IAM policies to manage access at a more granular level.

## Advanced Features

- **Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate the transition of objects to different storage classes or their deletion.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Host a static website directly from an S3 bucket.

## Example Use Cases

- **Backup and Restore**: Store backups of critical data.
- **Content Distribution**: Serve static content like images and videos.
- **Data Archiving**: Archive infrequently accessed data using S3 Glacier.
