# IAM User Limits and Groups

## IAM User Limits
- An IAM user can be a member of up to **10 groups**.
- There is a limit of **5000 IAM users** per AWS account.

## IAM Groups
- **IAM groups** are containers for users.
- Multiple IAM users can belong to multiple groups.
- **IAM groups** are not real identities, meaning:
  - They cannot log in.
  - They do not have credentials.

### Benefits of IAM Groups
1. **Administrative Management:** Groups can represent projects, teams, or functional units within a business.
2. **Policy Management:** You can attach policies to groups (both inline and managed), which are then merged into a single permission set for all users within the group.

### Limits of IAM Groups
- **No Nesting:** IAM groups cannot contain other groups.
- **Group Limit:** Each AWS account can have a maximum of **300 groups**.

## Resource Policies
- A **resource policy** is attached directly to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket).
- Example: A bucket can have a policy that allows specific users like "Sally" to access it.
- Policies can reference IAM users and roles by using their **ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).

- # When to Use IAM Role and When Not?

IAM roles are an essential part of AWS security, providing temporary credentials to AWS services and users, enabling them to perform actions on your behalf. Understanding when and how to use IAM roles can significantly enhance your cloud security posture.

## üéØ **When to Use IAM Role?**

IAM roles should be used in scenarios where you need to:

### üîπ **Allow AWS Services to Act on Your Behalf**
   - **Example:** Granting permissions to an AWS Lambda function to access other AWS resources like S3, DynamoDB, etc.

### üîπ **Enable Secure Access for EC2 Instances**
   - **Example:** Assigning a role to an EC2 instance so it can perform actions like reading from an S3 bucket without embedding access keys.

### üîπ **Facilitate Lambda Execution**
   - **Example:** When a Lambda function assumes a role, a **trust policy** is attached to it, enabling the function to perform actions as defined by the role.

### üîπ **Use as a Break-Glass Role**
   - **Example:** A role that acts as an emergency access role, to be used only when absolutely necessary. This is akin to the **Break Glass** concept in the physical world, where the key to something important is stored behind glass and should only be accessed in emergencies.

### üîπ **ID Federation**
   - **Example:** Allowing an external identity provider to assume a role and gain access to AWS resources is called **ID Federation**.

### üîπ **Cross-Account Access**
   - **Example:** When enabling cross-account access, IAM roles can be used to grant permissions to entities in other AWS accounts.

## üö´ **When Not to Use IAM Role?**

Avoid using IAM roles if:

- **Direct Access is Required**: If a user or service needs long-term credentials, IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials, might not be the best choice.
  
- **Access Control is Too Broad**: If your use case requires fine-grained, resource-level access controls, consider whether a role with broad permissions might inadvertently grant more access than necessary.

## üõ°Ô∏è **External Accounts and IAM Roles**

External accounts cannot directly access your AWS resources. Instead, you should:

1. **Allow IAM Role Assumption**: Configure your AWS environment to allow the external account to assume a specific IAM role.
2. **Generate STS Tokens**: Use AWS Security Token Service (STS) to provide temporary credentials.
3. **Apply Permission Policies**: Define and apply permission policies that grant the appropriate level of access to the external account via the assumed role.
